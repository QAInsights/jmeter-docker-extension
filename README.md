# 👨‍💻 Local development

You can use `docker` to build, install and push your extension. Also, using an opinionated [Makefile](Makefile) that could be convenient for you. There isn't a strong preference of using one over the other, so just use the one you're most comfortable with.

To build the extension, use `make build-extension` **or**:

```shell
  docker buildx build -t qainsights/jmeter-docker-extension:latest . --load
```

## 🌱 Installation 
### 🪜 Make
To install the extension, use `make install-extension` **or**:

```shell
  docker extension install qainsights/jmeter-docker-extension:latest
```

> If you want to automate this command, use the `-f` or `--force` flag to accept the warning message.

### 🗜️ Docker Extensions Marketplace (Recommended Method)

JMeter extension can be easily installed from the [Docker Extensions Marketplace](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=extension) via web or directly from Docker Desktop.

Docker Extensions are available as part of Docker Desktop 4.8.0 and later releases. [Download and install Docker Desktop 4.8.0 or later](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/).

To install an extension:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. From the Dashboard, select Add Extensions in the menu bar. The Extensions Marketplace opens on the Browse tab.
Search for `JMeter`.
3. Choose you extension and select Install.

From here, you can select Open to access the extension or install additional extensions. The extension also appears in the left-hand menu and in the Manage tab.

## 🎥 Preview the extension

To preview the extension in Docker Desktop, open Docker Dashboard once the installation is complete. 

The left-hand menu displays a new tab with the name of the extension which is `JMeter`. You can also use `docker extension ls` to see that the extension has been installed successfully.

Use the `docker extension update` command to remove and re-install the extension automatically:

```shell
docker extension update qainsights/jmeter-docker-extension:latest
```
> If you want to automate this command, use the `-f` or `--force` flag to accept the warning message.

> Extension containers are hidden from the Docker Dashboard by default. You can change this in Settings > Extensions > Show Docker Extensions system containers.

# 🪵 Update an extension

You can update any extension outside of Docker Desktop releases. To update an extension to the latest version:

1. Navigate to Docker Dashboard, and from the menu bar select the ellipsis to the right of Extensions.

3. Select Update.

# 🗑️ Clean up
